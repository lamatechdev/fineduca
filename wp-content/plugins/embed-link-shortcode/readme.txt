This plugin adds a shortcode to get a similar functionality that has facebook when a link is pasted to the input status.


== Description ==

'Embed Link ShortCode' tries to emulate the functionality that facebook has when a link is pasted to the input status.
But it doesn't happen when you paste a link in the body of a new post (as when you paste a youtube link in the visual view of a post), it's done using a shortcode.
The provided link to the shortcode is fetched to get the meta tags, and these meta tags are used to render the new post content. It tries to get an image and put it as
post default thumbnail, and it uses some meta tags to get title text and to add a quote. The order in the post content is: image, quote and link.
If you don't like the HTML render, you can always edit the code to change format or suggest me some changes.

Usage:

1- Create a new post.

2- Add only the shortcode with the link (in HTML mode, not Visual) in the post body. For example:

   [embedlink]http://example.com/example[/embedlink]

3- Push 'Save Draft'.

   If all is ok, the post content will be rewritten with the rendered html code. An image may be uploaded to the media library and added as post default thumbnail.
   If nothing happens, click the preview link and some message may be displayed. Otherwise, it will be a bug: please, report it adding the URL you used and the plugin version (update to last version before report!).

4- Review the generated code.


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and to get it working:

1. Upload and unzip `embed-link-shortcode.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory or use the standard Wordpress GUI way through the 'Plugins' menu to install the .zip file.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Enjoy the new shortcode!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why the post content (with the shortcode) is rewritten? =

Because if that were not done in that way, everytime the post were loaded in the browser, the shortcode would be executed (recursion alike).

== Changelog ==

= 3.0 =

* Tested in WP 4.7.

= 2.0 =
